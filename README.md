## Obstacle Avoidance System for Robotics

This Arduino-based obstacle avoidance system enhances the navigation capabilities of robotics platforms by providing real-time obstacle detection and feedback mechanisms. The system utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect nearby objects and controls vibration motors to provide feedback based on the proximity of detected obstacles.

### Features:
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple sensor pairs offer extensive coverage for obstacle detection from both the left and right sides.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjustable vibration intensity limits allow for fine-tuning based on specific requirements and environmental conditions.
- **Versatile Integration**: Designed for easy integration into various robotics projects, with straightforward control interfaces and flexible configuration options.
- **Enhanced Safety**: Promotes safe and efficient operation in dynamic environments by alerting the robot to obstacles in its path.
- **Open Source**: Available as open-source hardware and software, encouraging collaboration and further development within the robotics community.

### Usage:
1. **Setup**: Connect the ultrasonic sensors and vibration motors to the Arduino board as per the provided pin definitions.
2. **Upload**: Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the board using the Arduino IDE.
3. **Run**: Power up the system and observe the obstacle detection and feedback mechanism in action.
